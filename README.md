# YouTube Sentiment Analysis - Be Kind Rewind

## Description
I've always been fascinated by women in films and the real women who play them. Every year I try to see who are nominated for the top acting prize for women and I make sure to watch the performances that garnered them that nomination. I would also often search for videos of past winners and watch their acceptance speeches and to also see which exceptional actresses they were able to beat. 

So I was very glad to discover this YouTube channel called **Be Kind Rewind**. The channel is mainly about past best actress winners, women in film, and film and Hollywood history.The videos delve into the career of these accomplished women and the circumstances that lead to their win. The videos are well-researched and very insightful. I love history, I love film, and I love women in film so I trully enjoy every video from this channel. And so, I wanted to see what other people thought about this channel and its videos. In this project, I apply natural language processing (NLP) to determine the general sentiments on this channel. The results of this project will provide the creator behind this Youtube channel a good idea of how viewers perceive the content produced.
